# Introduction to ML

## Talk given at the University of Mauritius, on the 30th of August, 2019.

The slides have been prepared with hovercraft, which compiles restructured 
Text to impress.js presentations. If you wish to run the presentation, clone
this repository, then make sure to install hovercraft *from git*. This can
be done in this way:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/regebro/hovercrat
```

Once this is done, you can run the presentation by calling

```bash
hovercraft presentation.rst
```


The challenge is given in `challenge.jsonl`
